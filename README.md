## General Information
- Building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand of bike hires for BoomBikes company
- A bike-sharing company called BoomBikes has suffered a huge loss during COVID period and now they want to understand how different features influence the demand of bikes so that they can devise necessary buisness strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations of American market. 
- To analyse the increase and decrease in demand for bikes through various features so that the company can decide on appropriate actions to maximise profit
- day.csv dataset is used

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Expected increase in hiring bike in the next year by 0.23 times
- A unit increase in temp(temperature) might increase the demand by 0.54 times.
- A unit increase increase in windspeed might lead to decrease in bike demands by 0.19 times
- When the humidity increases, there is a drop in demand for bikes hiring by 0.18 times
- In summer, demand increases by 0.10 times
- In winter, demand increases by 0.15 times
- In august and september, demand increases by 0.06 and 0.12 times respectively
- When there is a light snow, demand decreases by 0.23 times
